# Learning Algorithms

To learn algorithms, I will implement various data structures, well-known algorithms that everyone is familiar with,
benchmarks, and simple tests. I aim to create the data structures myself as much as possible, without relying on
external crates. Additionally, besides famous algorithms like quicksort and the Sieve of Eratosthenes, I want to
implement algorithms that pique my interest, regardless of their genre.
